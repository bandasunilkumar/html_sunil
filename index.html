        <p>Kanjivaram saree derives its name from a small south Indian village â€“ Kanchipuram. This is where these sarees were made. This classic weave provides a thick fabric with gold or silver lace and motifs all over the body of the saree. </p>
        <p>The origin of the Kanchipuram saree dates back to centuries ago when these sarees used to be woven in temples. Kanchipuram sarees, woven from pure mulberry silk, are found in myriad colours. These sarees have borders and pallu in a contrasting colour with heavy gold weaving.</p>

        <p>In a genuine Kanchipuram Silk Sari, body and border are woven separately and then interlocked together. The joint is woven so strongly that even if the saris tears, the border will not detach. That differentiates the kanchivaram silk saris from the others.</p>
